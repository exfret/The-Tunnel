Menu-ing
1. "Back" is always the first option in "navigation menus" (those that aren't part of a narrative choice, but just to redirect the game where the player wants to go).
2. If "Back" doesn't immediately go back home, also include a "Back home" option (TODO: fix some places where that's not a thing)
