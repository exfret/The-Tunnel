You return to the orphanage with 12 fully harvested lemens, exhausted and yet excited for the weeks to come.

*page_break

The next few weeks consist of just exploration with George, him showing you around the tunnel's first layer. Towards the end, he even shows you the start of the second layer, the first one where there is any hope of finding new relics. However, you don't stay long enough to find any. At the end, he gives you an artifact. "Promise me you'll never get rid of this. I give it to all my mentees so that they remember me." It's a feather. "This has practical purpose, too. It will fly away if you are about to be in grave danger. It's very hard to catch and at that point you probably will want to just run, but one warning is better than none. It comes from a clackadoo bird that I was able to catch in the fourth layer. They are born with an instinct to always know when to flee danger, which makes them incredibly difficult to catch, but also bestows the feathers with that magical property I mentioned. Hold onto it as best as you can.

        The orphanage tells you it's really stressing out and needs you to help pay for yourself. Now, you will need to help pay for the travel supplies. Regardless of time spent in each travel, the number of [i]travel equipments[/i] you'll need only depends on the layer you go into. Farther layers will require exponentially more equipment.
        
        To help support your expensive tunneling hobby, the orphanage also recommends some farmers nearby needing farmhands, but also more strongly recommends to not dilly dally your life away collecting flowers in the tunnel.

    A young, thin woman looks up from a desk at the front of the orphanage's study. "I'm Mabel. I heard you have been exploring quite a lot, recently. It would only make sense to give you access to our dismal collection of knowledge and folklore surrounding the tunnel. You'll have to get access to the main town library for more in-depth knowledge. Just choose a subject to study and you can rent the book for a month."

The first part of the book is all about Lemens. What they are, how to find them, all sorts of things. Of course, you already know about them from your trips with George. Still, it gives some more tips on how to harvest them better. Lemen Fetch Skill +2.

    Of course, the book covers petunal blossoms. It just talks about how they're found near caves, but other than that, no new information.

    Apparently, there's a purple flower with yellow specks that can be found around the first layer. Its petals are apparently really nutritious. Your town is quite carnivorous, but you can think of a few vegetarians who would like the rare vitamins and minerals to be found in the petals. It says the petals are common and that you need a lot for a complete meal, however, so they won't fetch very much.

    The book then talks about a rose-like plant with big, broad leaves on its stem. It says that small parts of the leaves are used for expensive teas. You wonder if you've already seen any around while exploring the tunnel.

    The final part discusses starblossom, that one flower (why is it all about flowers?). The book mainly focuses on harvesting techniques, noting that a special harvest tool grade 2 is needed to pick the flower (SHTG2).

*else
    The final part discusses a rarer flower named the starblossom, whose petals are large and shaped like a five-pointed star. It is perpetually in bloom apparently, but survives much better in layers two and three, and thus is rare to find in layer one. Apparently, a special harvest tool called the SHTG2 is needed to scavenge it from the ground due to its deep roots.

    Unfortunately, since you didn't know any of the topics in the book other than about Lemens, it takes you an extra month to complete it. Mabel let's you keep it for longer, but more of your youth has been wasted away.
