*label rest_explanation

— Implemented "rest" mechanic: you now lose some rest each time you do an action that takes energy. You can keep doing some things if your rest is less than zero, but you will be less effective at tasks and may not notice some secret features of the environment!

Unfortunately, your character has insomnia and cannot sleep in the Tunnel, and also cannot get a truly restful sleep in the same place more than once (though finding something comforting in an area may allow them to rest there more times). This will force you to find new places if you want your character to be in their best shape.

You start off with an ample amount of rest for a while, and resting only gives you up to 24 rest or +15 rest, whichever is smallest, so you get the max rest when you wait until you have 9 or less rest to sleep. However, some special events only occur with at least 15 rest, so there's a tradeoff between being the most rested all the time and using your resting places wisely.

Finally, resting always costs a month of time, even if nothing already says so, so keep that in mind.

The first is about a stone of persuasion. Apparently they're found every once in a while and most sales jobs require one. They're the only type of artifact that regenerate, often found in caves. You didn't know that there were such artifacts. And they can be found in the first layer, too! You don't remember seeing any in the shops of the town, so you'll probably have to find one yourself.

You also read about persistence artifacts. Apparently, certain artifacts are known to appear after a certain number of trips to a given layer. As soon as you hit that number of trips, you get one. It says that most people receive a persistence artifact only 2 trips into the second layer! There's a gotcha though, you have to know about the persistence artifacts for the counter to start. Good thing you read this book!

The third is about a special type of coin called the blue coin. Apparently, it's not really an artifact, just a type of currency that's only found in the tunnel or in special shops, but some places only take blue coins. They apparently look like pointy spheres, whatever that means.

Knock knock

*page_break

You wake up one day to find Hallie knocking on your door. Hallie is the financial overseer of the orphanage, and usually she only brings bad news. Her most often catchphrase is, "We can't afford to have you here any longer," which is what she says before a troublesome or otherwise expensive orphan is kicked out. But you can't imagine they'd kick out you.

Right?

*page_break

Hallie guides you down to the orphanage office corridor and into your office. She motions for you to sit on the hard, creaky chair across from her. The last time you sat in this chair, the orphanage told you to start paying for your own Tunnel trips. Oh what a joy that's been…

Hallie looks serious. She's actually quite young, but this job has set early wrinkles into her skin. "Director Dicky is stepping down." The cogs in your head turn as you process what that means. Dicky is the primary funder of the orphanage. If he's stepping down, that means he's becoming less involved, which probably means… She continues, "…and he's pulling out all his funding for this place."

You gasp. You didn't think it would be that bad. Hallie's voice cracks a little as she says, "I'm losing my job, that's for sure. Mabel's teas bring in a very good deal of profit, too, but she can only really make a big batch once a year and the ingredients are expensive."

"We need you to move out by your 300'th Month. This is pretty standard for most orphanages, we tried to break the mold and allow adult orphans since we know how hard it can be with all the anti-orphan discrimination in this town, but you're gonna have to the be first one to show others how to survive on their own around here. You think you can do that?"

*label artifact_dungeon

In this dungeon, you will be asked to give up all your worldly possessions of a single type. If you do, you will receive an artifact, but only if you haven't gotten to that level of the dungeon before.

So, for example, to get to level 1 of the dungeon, you must give up all your Lemens (excluding immortal lemens). If you've never gotten to level 1 before, you would then be rewarded with the artifact corresponding to that level and booted out of the dungeon. However, if you'd previously collected the level 1 artifact, then you would then be asked to give up all your Rosalia. And so on.

Make sure that if you want the artifact, you are willing to lose all of the thing corresponding to the level you need to go to, AND each of the levels before it! Your current artifact dungeon level is ${layer_2_artifact_dungeon_level}. That means you would have to give up everything in the following list including and before this number to get a new artifact.

The list? Right, the dungeon has 10 layers, that's 10 unique artifacts. And you can only come here by a random general exploration (one in twenty chance, by the way), so there's a high chance you're giving up something valuable here. Anyways, to get through the levels, you need…
