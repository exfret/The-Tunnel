    #Rosalia
        Rosalia is a rose-like plant with big, broad, deep red leaves and smaller leaves along its stem. These smaller leaves are often crushed up to create teas. Most commonly thought to only exist in the first layer until hordes of them were found in layer five.
    #Mother of Specters
        Yellow flowers with short petals and a sweet, buttery smell to them. Extremely poisonous. Named after the number of ghosts they've caused. Note: Mother of Specters Fetch skill acts differently than other fetch skills at this point. It has a skill tree rather than contributing directly to harvesting more Mother of Specters.

    #Ghostly flower circles
